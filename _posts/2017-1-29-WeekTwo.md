### What did you do this past week?
Last week I worked on the first project for OOP. 

### What's in your way?


### What will you do next week?

### What's my experience of the class?


### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
This [article](https://lifepluslinux.blogspot.com/2017/01/look-before-you-paste-from-website-to.html) is my pick of the week. It's an interesting article about why you should be more wary when copy-pasting commands into the terminal. In the article the author shows how you can hide malicious code within commands. Many terminals immediately execute pasted commands, so someone can unknowningly run malicious code. After reading this, I doubt i'm going to blindly paste from websites anymore.
