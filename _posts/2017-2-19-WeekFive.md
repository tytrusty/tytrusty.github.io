title: Week of 13 Feb - 19 Feb
---

### What did you do this past week?
Last week I spent a bunch of time finishing up the Voting project. Having the Hackerrank contest for the project made the experience easygoing. Passing the tests provides quick assurance that we'll get full credit for code correctness. On Friday, we learned about consts in C++ which are surprisingly complex. On Tuesday I went to the career fair, which as usual is a draining event. 

### What's in your way?
With no projects until after the test, all I have to worry about in OOP is preparing for quizzes and the first midterm. My main concern right now is getting an internship. I have been applying to quite a few places, so I hope that ends up going well. Also, I was lazy about getting this class's textbook (using the free samples), so I will probably have to borrow the book before Monday's quiz. 

### What will you do next week?
I plan to get started studying for the test next week. Having no project in OOP leaves me plenty of time to work ahead in my other classes. As Iâ€™ve mentioned I have been trying to get a summer internship, so I will continue to work on that next week. 

### What's my experience of the class?
This week's lectures were great. Downing's analogy relating paintball and C++ consts made Friday's lecture entertaining. I am finally starting to get used to the daily quizzes, so I am enjoying the class much more. The lectures continue to be interesting since we learn a whole lot of content each time. Moreover, the exercises where we try to implement examples are engaging (and probably helpful preparation for tests). 

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My tip of the week would be to start studying as early you can. Since Downing hasn't assigned any projects right now, that extra time should be taken advantage of and used to prepare for the test. Even though the test is 11 days from the time I am writing this, test days approach rapidly. Right now I don't know what exactly to prepare for, but I am going to spend some time every day going over the examples.
