### My experience
MY experience in OOP was excellent. It's a worthwhile experience and leaving it I feel that I have good grasp of OOP and C++. Professor Downing's style is lot different than any other CS professors I've had. The teaching style and structure of the course are unique and clearly well though out. C++ can be intimidating, but Downing explains each concept extremely clearly. Also on some particularly challenging concepts he had humorous analagies to help us understand things better. 

The lectures are far more engaging than any other CS classes I've taken. Throughout the lectures Professor Downing randomly calls on students and poses questions usually relating to some piece of code. At first this was extremely nerve-wracking for me, but it got mucher easier as the semester progressed. Like most people, I speak up in class because I don't want to make a fool of myself. The thing with OOP is that pretty much everyone makes a mistake when questioned, so there's little shame in being incorrect. This style of teaching It's a breath of fresh air from all my classes that depend heavily on powerpoints. 

### Tests
One unique thing about tests in OOP is that they're done through Canvas and you take your laptop to the test. The best part is there's no waiting for your score because you get it back immediately after clicking submit. The only complication I had with the online exams is that my laptop is unreliable. For example, it likes to randomly crash when I move it. Having issues like this can create some anxiety because you'll be in a constant worry during the exam. In my case, my laptop crashed exactly when the final exam started, which was awful since I had to sit for a couple minutes while it rebooted. So if you plan take this class, get any computer issues sorted out. 

### Projects
The projects are a lot like programming competition questions, but modified so that you have to apply some OOP concepts. For me the most time-consuming part of the projects was not the actual coding part. For each project, there are a lot of steps to setting up a programming environment and you also have to write tests and documentation. These things often felt like chores, but they made me a much better programmer. Looking back at my personal projects before taking this class, they're a complete mess. But now, I've been able to use all the tools I used in these projects so everything is much more organized. And as an added benefit, employers really liked it when I told them that I had experience with unit testing and continuous integration. 

### Quizzes
Quizzes were the most challenging part of the class for me. The content of the quizzes was difficult, but fair. There would usually be one or two reading questions a week. THen the other questions would typically be ones where you have to analyze a snippet of code and determine the output. This was the source of the most difficulty because of the time limit on the quizzes. Although, the scariest part for me was the lack of a back button. My testing style is to answer every question as fast as possible, then go back to the beginning and fix the errors. This obviously doesn't work for the quizzes, but fortunately I discovered this reality on the first quiz and was able to adjust my style.
