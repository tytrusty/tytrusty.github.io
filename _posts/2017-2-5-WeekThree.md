title: Week of 23 Jan - 29 Jan
---

### What did you do this past week?
This past week I finished and turned in project 1 for OOP.  Last week I mentioned that I wanted to use some free time to work on personal projects. I ended having some time so I tried to apply the concepts from OOP to my project. The project is in python so it took a little extra work learning how to do unit testing. However, the github for CS373 was extremely helpful. Now I see why Downing suggested that we make unit tests before we start programming. I had not designed any of the functions to be easily tested, so it took some work trying to find ways to make some unit tests. 

### What's in your way?
Right now in OOP not much is in my way. Quizzes, as usual, stress me out. Though for the most part, they have been going well. What's mainly been in my way right now is another course of mine. This course is an anthropology writing flag course with a heavy amount of reading.  

### What will you do next week?
Next week I would like to get started on the next OOP project. I haven't read the specifications and I haven't decided on a partner yet. I plan on doing both of those things by Monday. By about mid-week I would like to start working on the project and make some decent progress. Fortunately project 1 gave me an understanding of the workflow, so the main difficultly will be the hackerrank problem. 

### What's my experience of the class?
THe first project went well, I think. I finished with plenty of time to spare, but I spent a good amount of extra time ensuring that I fulfilled all the requirements from the workflow.  

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My tip of the week would be to work on a personal project. Working on projects is great because it allows you to create something completely unique that you can take some degree of pride in. School projects are great, but the assignments usually don't align with everybodies' interests. So if you have a little idea you're interested in, make some free time and work on it. It won't feel like work if you're actually interseted in it too.
