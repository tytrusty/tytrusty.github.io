title: Week of 24 Apr - 30 Apr
---

### What did you do this past week?
Last week in OOP we learned more about handler classes and began talking about unique_ptr and share_ptr classes. I have used these classes in the past so it's great to actually understand what's going on behind the scenes when you use them. We had our last quiz on Wednesday, so all I've got left is the final exam. For the quizzes, I had some periods of poor performance throughout the semester, but overall I'm content with my grade. 

### What's in your way?
This week is my finals week. I've got an essay due and three final exams. I began studying fairly early so I am not too worried about being prepared, but it will still be a challenge. For OOP, I started working on my note page this weekend. I feel like this has been the best way to prepare since it's forced me to review all the notes, exercises, and quizzes really in-depth. Another thing I have to do next week is a project presentation in my anthropology-related class. I've talked in front of groups a number of times, but I don't think I've ever exceeded 10 minutes. I'm not too thrilled with public speaking, but this will be great practice.

### What will you do next week?
Study study study. All my finals are this Thursday so that leaves Monday-Wednesday of complete studying. One problem I have is that I'll sometimes force myself to keep working until I am satisfied with my studying, which entails working late into the night. Being well-rested is crucial, so I can't allow myself to stay up any later than 3 a.m. This time still sounds ridiculous, but if I didn't regulate my schedule I would end up staying up to almost 6 a.m. and obliterating my sleep schedule. 

### What's my experience of the class?
Class has continued to be great. The lectures are always informative and I feel like I'm learning for the entire 50 minute duration. This class has made a great impression upon me and I definitely plan to take SWE in the future. 

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My pick of the week is [this](https://web.stanford.edu/~learnest/les/crypto.htm) interesting article called "How I got an FBI record at age 11 from dabbling in cryptography then got into more trouble". If you're looking to take a quick break, I would recommend this article as its short and pretty amusing.
