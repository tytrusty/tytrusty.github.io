title: Week of 20 Mar - 26 Mar
---

### What did you do this past week?
I finished up the allocator project. Things went smoothly so there wasn't any pressure to get things done before the deadline. Outside of OOP I took a test for language credit in Chinese. I was nervous about this since I have been learning independently for almost a year and I had yet to be tested in my ability. Fortunately, things ended up going well and I got enough credit to fulfill my degree requirement. 

### What's in your way?
I have a decent amount of work in my other courses so that's the main thing in my way. In OOP, the next test is still over a month away, which makes the next projects and quizzes the only thing I am concerned about. With OOP and my other classes, it will be a challenge to stay on top of the OOP reading and class content this week. But looking at these things in a positive light, all this can be seen as a good exercise in my time management skills.

### What will you do next week?
I would like to get started on the project next week. I believe we will begin discussion of the project this Monday so that will give me a chance to get a head start. Besides OOP I have a test and essay in my other courses, which will use all my time until Tuesday. 

### What's my experience of the class?
My experience of this class has been great. I haven't been doing that well on some of my previous quizzes, but the content of the class has remained interesting. I am glad that Downing has provided a decent chunk of extra credit opportunities to supplement my grade. For instance, this Monday there is a talk I can attend to get 5 extra points. These opportunities make me feel much better about some of the stupid mistakes I make on the quizzes.

I am really looking forward to next week classes as we will be learning more on how vectors are implemented. Last class in OOP we had to do an exercise where we had to implement a basic version of the vector class. Sometimes sitting and listening can get dull, so I'm glad Downing makes us do exercises where we attempt to implement what we're learning. This is definitely my favorite thing about OOP right now. Also, I feel like these exercises are helpful in preparing for the upcoming test. 

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My pick of the week is the site [colormind.io](http://colormind.io/blog/) where the creator used machine learning to generate color palettes that abide by color theory.
