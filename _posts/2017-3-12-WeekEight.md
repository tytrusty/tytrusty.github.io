title: Week of 5 Mar - 12 Mar
---

### What did you do this past week?
In OOP, we were introduced to the next project -- the Allocator project. This project seems more challenging than Voting and Collatz, so I'm really looking forward to working on it. Outside of OOP, I had a midterm in intro to computer security, which went well. 

### What's in your way?
Not a whole lot. Because the next OOP test is quite a ways away, I only have to worry about the next project and the quizzes. I've finally finished my first set of midterms so these next few weeks should be more easy-going. One thing I am a bit concerned about is an upcoming credit-by-exam in Chinese that I am taking. I've been learning it on my own for almost a year now for fun, but I figured I might as well try to get some college credit out of it. This test is the Tuesday after the break, which gives me a whole class-free week to prepare. 

### What will you do next week?
It's Spring Break, so I'm mostly going to relax. I plan on getting most of the next OOP project done. Thankfully, we spent a good amount of time in class going over the project, which makes me fairly confident that it won't be too difficult. 

### What's my experience of the class?
My experience of this class has been great. The daily quizzes aren't fun, but the lectures and projects have been great. In the coming lectures, I hope we will start to discuss more about OOP principles. Right now the content of the class has mostly focused on the intricacies of C++. This is understandable because I feel like we need a solid grasp of the language before we can take advantage of its full capabilites.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My tip of the week would be to learn some android development. I would recommend going through Google's [android training lessons](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html) to learn some of the basics. You can also try out the [Android Udacity course] (https://www.udacity.com/courses/android) if you'd like a more structured approach. Personally what worked for me is to think of a basic app to build, then learn along the way. Whenever I don't know something, I read Stackoverflow and the developer documentation. While this is unorganized, I like this approach as you immediately apply what you learn.
