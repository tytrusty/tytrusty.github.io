### What did you do this past week?
Last week we were introduced to the next oop project, Darwin. This is the first program where I feel like I am actually programming in an object oriented style. 
Also last week I attended a tech talk with Atlassian. Sometimes when I go to company tech talks I feel like it feels like i'm watching a company commercial, but this tech talk was different. During the talk they went into specific details on how
### What's in your way?
Not much is in my way since all my remaining midterms are near the end of the semester. In OOP, I do have the next project to do, but things have going well. The "no getters and setters" portion of the project represented achallenge, but my partner and I spent our first two work days planning the design.

### What will you do next week?
Next week I will be finishing the Darwin project. My groupmember and I have finished most of the design, which leaves unit tests, documentation, and other various requirements. 

### What's my experience of the class?
Class has been great. We've been discussing vectors in the past few classes. Initially, Downing introduced us to an inefficient implementation of vector. In these classes we were tasked with performing exercises to implement particular components  

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My pick of the week is this blog about [the programming language pipeline](https://medium.com/@william01110111/the-programming-language-pipeline-91d3f449c919). The author describes the process of making your own programming language. The explanations are great and after reading I now plan on making my own simple language.
